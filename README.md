# Billing App

A batch application that generates billing reports for an imaginary cellphone company called Spring Cellular. The application stores billing information in a relational database and generates a billing report. This application is based on Spring Boot and uses Spring Batch's features to create a robust batch-processing system that is restartable and fault-tolerant.
